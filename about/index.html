  <h2>Thankful.ly<br/><br/>
    for all the hard work our teachers do for us, we thought of gifting them something special but you might not be able to go to school and give them something because everything is online, we bring you this platform that will help you gift them something memorable.

## What it does -
this platform is designed for students who want to show their love and respect to the teachers who worked hard for them. Students can send thank you to them in the form of greeting cards, wholesome messages or even give them some money as a token of respect. If the teacher recieves it they will get a notification via twillio as an sms.
