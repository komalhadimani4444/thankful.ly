## 💡 Inspiration -

for all the hard work our teachers do for us, we thought of gifting them something special but you might not be able to go to school and give them something because everything is online, we bring you this platform that will help you gift them something memorable.
⚙ What it does -

this platform is designed for students who want to show their love and respect to the teachers who worked hard for them. Students can send thank you to them in the form of greeting cards, wholesome messages, or even give them some money as a token of respect. If the teacher receives it they will get a notification via twillio as an SMS.

## 🔧 How we built it-

We made a system to send alerts to the teacher whenever a student sends an appreciation text or a card, they could view it by clicking the link by the use of twillio which sends SMS to their number. We also have an option where students could gift any amount they like to the teacher, we tried to implement a paywall by the use of stripe. twilio

## 💪 Challenges we ran into -

We tried implementing the paywall with the use of stripe but it was very difficult and we were running out of time, we implemented a prototype that will help us understand how it will work if implemented correctly.

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of -

Even after the challenges we faced , we finished it on time and this project will help in teachers funding as well as to make wholesome memories between students and teachers

## 📚 What we learned -

We learned the use of stripe and Paysafe APIs although we could not implement it completely, learning the UI was very fun. We learned the use of twillio

## ⏭ What's next for -

implement the paywall and make it a complete web app that can be used by students and teachers.
